ISSUE
Student has written a bit of javascript code that runs as soon as the LMS it opened to the proejct.  It forces a popup and it's an infinite looping popup.  Student can't stop it because opening the LMS is defacto opening a browser that runs the javascript code. 

FIX 
(1) Dump Cookies from browser
(2) Log into the LMS. 
(3) Before re-starting the offending course / lesson
(4) Open the FireFox dev tools console
(5) Add this ==>  window.alert = function() {};
(6) This should bind the offending alert to an inert function. 
(7) Allowing you to remove the offending code
