Selecting when a modal is involved 
/*CODE*/
var findPoint = webDriver.FindElements(
	By.CssSelector("div[style=\"display: block;\"].modal button.cc-image-uploader-save-btn"));



	
*using CssSelector Find a DIV named 'col-md-2.col-md-offset-7'
* the . represents a space between them 
*  To make a compound selector using the space ' ' indicates some where in the children of the previous selector
*   To make a compound selector using the arrow '>' indicates the immediate child element. 
** div.foo  == means look for a div named 'foo'  
**  button.foozy == means look for a button named 'foozy'
var singleElement = webDrVr.FindElement(By.CssSelector("div.col-md-2.col-md-offset-7 button.cc-image-uploader-save-btn"));

NOW we are generating an array of elements by telling it to find.. 
* Look for anything that's a 'Button'  and has the name cc-image-uploader-save-btn"  
** BUT these may be hidden behind other modal windows.  
*** This actually returns 4 elements items when it looks like there would be only 2
***** BECAUSE ~ there are some hidden behind the active modal window.  
var anElmentArray = webDrVr.FindElements(By.CssSelector("button.cc-image-uploader-save-btn"));


NOW NOW how to interact with only the active modal. 
* We are going to create an array of elements that are only visible. 
** We need to tell SE that it needs to find things within the div that has the style display because there are multiple modal windows that are not visable. 
*** Pattern to remember == By.CssSelector("div[style=\"display: block;\"].modal but...
***** This tells to look for a div who has the escaped character example style display: block
var anElmentArray = webDrVr.FindElements(By.CssSelector("div[style=\"display: block;\"].modal button.cc-image-uploader-save-btn"));



BUT THIS WORKED??
By.CssSelector("div.col-md-2.col-md-offset-7 button.cc-image-uploader-save-btn")

To find something that is listed by list items then other css classes.  

webDriver.FindElement(By.CssSelector("li.cc-user-widget")).Click();  <== will click the element 

Such as what shows on Web Pages. 
*NOTE NOTE** FireFox and Chrome display role in different order. 

YOU WANT TO SELECT THE WIDGET BECAUSE IT'S THE USER UPDATE ICON

<li id="dropdown-notifications" class="dropdown dropdown-notifications " role="presentation">...</li>
<li class="cc-user-widget" role="presentation">
	<a action="push" href="/profile">
      <span> ... react text user name ... </span>
	  <img class="cc-default-avatar img-circle" src="foo" style=width: 30px;">
	</a>
</li>


/*****************************************/
/**  CSS selections NEXT item groups ****/
/***************************************/

You have a group of elements and you need to select them. 
Buttons are a good example, you want the first of two or 10. 

var buttons = webDriver.FindElements(By.CssSelector("div.cc-course-module li.list-group-item > button")); 

THAT WILL GIVE YOU AN ARRAY OF ELEMENTS AND NAME THEM BUTTONS. NEXT CLICK THE FIRST ONE. 

buttons[0].Click();
