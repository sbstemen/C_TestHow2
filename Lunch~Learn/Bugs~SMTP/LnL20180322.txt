BUGS
Bugs ~ How to tell a developer 'It really is a bug'; and when to know the developer really was right?

* yard stick 

* By Design ~ Good vs BAD

* Perfect never launches. 

* SMTP RFC's 
~ RFC-561 was proposed or ratified in = 1973
~ RFC-733 was proposed or ratified in == 1977
~ RFC-822 was proposed or ratified in  ==  1982
~ RFC-2822 was proposed or ratified in ==  2001
~ RFC-5322  Was proposed or ratified in ==  2008 
BASE URL https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc<NUMBER>.txt

* "Legal Chars" 
Wikipedia 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address 

digits 0 to 9;
special characters !#$%&'*+-/=?^_`{|}~;

* Remote 
vs
* Local

LOCAL Focus B4  who controls remote?  ICANN

* Q1 ~ Is Scott@Domain.Com 
different than 
* sCoTT@dOMAin.cOM ??

* Normalized (Reference) 

Focus is Local  Left of the '@' sign

What's legally OK to use?

A~B a~b 0~9

(Side Bug is the ASCII boundary layers.) 

What about the period '.'

What about the pound or hash tag '#'?

What does the RFC say?  'read read read read read read....'

MEAT of the issue:

Let us examine what an SMTP email alias is first. 

* Local Part  == YourNameYouGiveOut 
* Separator   ==  ' @ '  The AT sign 
* Remote Part ==  AnyDomainThatIsLegal.???

Start with Domains. 
* What were the original top 6 TLD domains.  
*.COM 
*.GOV 
*.MIL
*.EDU
*.ORG 
*.NET 

* then everything went to hell in a hand basket and we now have domains like *.CLUB, or .ROCKS, and even .GURU.  
For this reason everything from the @ sign to the end is going to be assumed to be perfect.  Domain names will be another L&L. 

What about the Local part, that part of your eamil alias that goes before the At sign, '@'?

We all try to have unique can catchy sounding names like FuzzyBunny@Domain.Com  

Is 'FuzzyBunny' legal?  YES

What about Fuzzy.Bunny?  or Fuzzy-Bunny or Fuzzy+Bunny???  

I am asking what are the valid and legal letters in anybody's email alias?  

Let's start with a couple of assumptions, any alpha Chars from the letter A to Z and numbers 0 to 9 are good.  

Next what about NON-alpha Chars?  

We know that the period is legal, and the '@' At Sign isn't that's a Separator.  

What about the others?  
~ Funny side note, as I was typing this up in the Visual Code tool, I wasn't looking at the screen I was just hammering out these charcerers.  My screen whet crazy.  
They are 
/****************/

`~!@#$%^&*()_+=-|}{[][\":;'?><,./

Or what about € or even  ª  or ¥

/****************/

I sound liek im off on a wild tangent, so let's pull this back to bugs. 

If your email alias was Fuzzy.Bunny@HotMail.Com would that work would the email get to you?
JProbably 

What about Fluffy+Bunny would the plus sign work?  ~ maybe 

Let's be really specific

From the Exeter site you enter the name Fluffy+bunny@Hotmail.Com 
It accepts that and you think you are done with the registration part.  
Knowing that you require a second email you patiently wait for it, but none shows up?  

What's wrong? 
We are going to break this down to the answer, and identify when it's a bug, and when it's NOT a bug. 
Like I said last time we have to break things down into the smallest parts.  
* you entered the wrong email alias? 
* The system did provide you an error that the email was unaccptable but you ignored it. 
* The system (Exeter LMS == System) Cannot accept the email alias with a '+' but doesn't warn the user. 
* The system CAN and Does handle an email with a plus '+' but when it goes to our local email server (OES) that's where it fails. 
* Our OES handles it but during the store && Forward part of transnition one of the mystery servres fails (MES)
* The Users email server (EUES) will allow him to create such an account but it doesn't accept inbound connections (YES Really)
* The whole shooting match works, EXCEPT the end users reader  (Thunderbird or Outlook) didn't work (Not Likely)

Is each of these cases a bug?  Short answer ~ YES
In each of these cases is Exeter responsible ~ NO
