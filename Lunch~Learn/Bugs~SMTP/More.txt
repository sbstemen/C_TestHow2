What is your yardstick?  We all have one.

Favorite?  

Do 1's and 0's matter in today's world of high level languages and JIT compiliations?

Simple add box
[ # ] + [ # ] = Value

0 in both 
1 in both
9 in both
...
A in both
Z in Both 
Why would I put in a period '.' ?
Would an Ampersand '&' be better than a ( or )?
So we tested these ! & + - ) * (

any others?  

What about the Colon sign : 
and 
The slash that leans to the right /

Why are those important 

ASCII 
is the zero value character hex, DECIMAL, Binary and Octal 0?

NO

CHR : DEC : HEX : OCT : BINARY  
 0     48    30    060  0011 0000
 1     49    31    061  0011 0001
 Down to
 9     57    39    071  0011 1001

 So what comes before the zero 0 


CHR : DEC : HEX  : OCT : BINARY  
 /     47    29    057  0010 1111
 0     48    30    060  0011 0000
 1     49    31    061  0011 0001
 Down to
 9     57    39    071  0011 1001
 :     58    3A    072  0011 1010


 Now you can see why the slash / and Colon : are worth testing in even a simple thing.  

Is ASCII the only way to encode?  

HTML 

EBCDIC
Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Coded
Same chart in EBCDIC
CHR : DEC : HEX :  OCT : BINARY  
      239    EF    357  ‭1110 1111‬‬
 0    240    F0    360  1111 0000
 1    241    F1    361  1111 0001
 Down to
 9    249    F9    371  1111 1001
 |    250    FA    372  1111 1010

In the above example there are two interesting history lessons here. 
1 ~ Old IBM coders didn't use comma delimited fields they used the Pipett ' | ' vertical bar. 
2 ~ there is no lower boundary that needs to be tested.

 Email Aliases

 Ever break one down into it's parts.  

 Domain first everything to the right of the '@' symbol.  
 Who controls that?  DP  
 No ICANN  International Committee for Assigning Network Names. 

 Basically it can be Letters, Numbers, the Dash '-' and a period.  
 So let's ignore the remote part of a email alias.  

 The other part is called the local part.
