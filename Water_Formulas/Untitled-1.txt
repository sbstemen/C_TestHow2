A = πr2h

In practice, it's usually easier to measure the diameter of the circular cross-section (d) 
than it is to measure radius. Since radius is half the diameter (r = d/2) the equation 

becomes A = π (d/2)2h = πd2/22 •h = πd2/4 • h, which simplifies to:

A = π (d/2)2h

A = πd2/22 •h 

A = πd2/4 • h

A = (πd2h) ÷ 4
