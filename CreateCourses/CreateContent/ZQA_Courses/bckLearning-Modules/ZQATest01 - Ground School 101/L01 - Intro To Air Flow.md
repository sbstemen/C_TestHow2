## What is that keeps heavy things in the air?

Today we discuss how anything that weights more than air can actually get into the air. 

Most people believe in the Bernoulli Principal.  Famous mathematician and noted physicist Daniel Bernoulli born in 1700 developed a theory that dealt with the flow of fluid dynamics specifically with respect to the flow of gases. 

When a volume of fluid flows through a fixed space if it flows faster, the pressure drops, while if it flows slower the pressure will raise.

If we examine a birds wing, they are curved on the top of their wings and while not flat on the bottom air will flow in a reasonably flat direction.   

This principal was introduce by a couple of bicycle manufactures from the great state of Ohio. The top of their wing was not flat, but was curved, and the bottom was as well similar to a birds wing.

At very slow velocities the performance of this design can generate a great deal of lift given the surface area.  So much so that at higher velocities it becomes so efficient that this style of wing can't be used at high speed.  A very good example of this is the front or leading slats that move forward on the wing, while combined with the trailing fowler flaps on a modern jet liner in landing configurations.  Google for a 747 wing in landing condition, and you will see it's curved on both the top and bottom.  This improves lift at very low velocities.

The air moves around and supports things that should fall out of the sky.
