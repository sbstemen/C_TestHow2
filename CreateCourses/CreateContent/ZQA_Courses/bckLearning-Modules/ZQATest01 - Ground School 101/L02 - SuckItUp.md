# How curves work to keep things flying

---

We are going to target a brief examples of how the Bernoulli theory works. 

---

## Why the curves matter?

As studied by Bernoulli it doesn't matter if it's liquid or air, the movement of these two mediums have similar properties. 

As fluid passes a point let us measure the pressure.  For an example let us say the pressure is 10 PSI and the volume passing that point 3 gallons per minute.  

If the volume or speed of the fluid increases to 10 gallons per minute the pressure will drop. 

The inverse is also true, slow down the volume or speed of the fluid passing a particular point the pressure will rise.  

Speed is important, the faster an airfoil moves through the medium of air, the more lift it creates. 

It is often explained as if two molecules of air are separated at the leading edge of an airfoil. These to molecules want to reunite at the trailing edge of the airfoil.  The one going over the top or more curved section needs to travel faster.  while the one under the wing moves slower.  

Faster is a lower pressure while slow is a higher pressure.  Pushing the wing up. It is this shape that is similar to the shape of a birds wing that was employed by the Wright Brothers. 

Air flows over the top of a curved surface of an airfoil faster than the flat bottom.  The oddity of this is if the wing has a concaved shape (Like that of a bird) it actually generates more lift than if it was just a flat bottom.

The conclusion we can draw is that a bird's wing is curved and it flies.
