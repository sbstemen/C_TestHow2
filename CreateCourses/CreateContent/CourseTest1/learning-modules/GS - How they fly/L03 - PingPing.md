## Course Overview

Other ways to create lift. 
 

-----------
# How to balance lift and drag. 

## What happens if there are no curves?

We studied how the shape of a wing can generate lift, but there are airplanes that have the same amount of curve on the top of the wing as on the bottom.  This is called a symmetrical airfoil.  If we use Bernoulli's theory of more curve on the top than the bottom is what lifts and airfoil, what happens if the curves are identical?

Can it fly? YES, an example is the WW2 plane, North American P-51, and boy could it fly.  

The effect is similar to the video.  In the video a person skims across water on a flat piece of wood.  

And that is exactly how an aircraft with symmetrical airfoil flies.  The wing skims through the air and generates lift to support the weight of the airplanes.  

I all this the Ping Ping theory of how air fly.

The conclusion we can draw is the curve alone of a wing is not 100% responsible for lift.
